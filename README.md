# get_next_line

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor or standard input.
Here a new concept is introduced: static variables.

## Mandatory part
* Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
* Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
* Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.
* Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
* Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the get_next_line() function.
* Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.
* Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read(). The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette in order to test your code.
* You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example): cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
* We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didnâ€™t reach the end of file.
* We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.

###### Forbidden
* lseek() is forbidden.
* Global variables are forbidden.
